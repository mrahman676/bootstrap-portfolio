# Using HTML, CSS & Bootstrap to re-design a my work portfolio  web page.

## Created to re-create my portfolio webpage using bootstrap to make page structure, css styling and web responsivity better.

This is a redesign of my work portfolio. The aim of created this page was to showcase teachings of Bootstrap integrating into HTML structure and CSS styling had been implemented which in turn has produced a more professional and sleek design as opposed to the previous work portfolio. In this project it was required that

*The website should include components such as a navigation menu at the top with links to appropriate sections

* A work section displaying my work in grid using bootstrap cards for each project

* A skills section listing out skills I expect to learn from the bootcamp

* An about me section alongside a contact section and a footer section below

* That all hyperlinks display a hover effect and box shadow upon hover and that appropriate functions are used to minimise media queries

## Usage

* In the navigation bar within the header there are 4 buttons (Home, Work, Skills, About / Contact Me) that redirect you to each section of web page. 
* In the main body of the web page you can find a section titled 'Work' with a carousel containing cards which you can flick through the view my past projects.
* Then you can find a section titled 'Skills' with several icons of tools I expect to learn over the course of the bootcamp that can be hovered over upon.
* Lastly, there is a 'About / Contact Me' section which has two paragraphs and three icons that when clicked lead you to my Linkedin, email, and number.
